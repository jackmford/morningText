# morningText

Attempting to eliminate having to manually check Google Calendar in the morning. This application sends a text message at a specified time of day that includes all tasks found in one's calendar that day.

**Requires these Python libraries: schedule, twilio, and Google Calendar. Also must have the Google Calendar API enabled for a Google account as well as a _credentials.json_ file located in the same directory as _goodmorning.py_. Credentials can be generated [here](https://developers.google.com/calendar/quickstart/python).**
